		<p>
			Hello there, I have 3 years of experience as a UX designer, but my journey
			begun with my interest in drawing and art that goes back to when I was a
			child. This interest led me to study computer graphics and multimedia at
			Bangkok University International. While there, I discovered UX design and
			found my passion. I have always been fascinated by the psychological
			aspect of UX design and enjoy doing the research and analysis that
			underpin effective design. While at Morphosis, I have worked on projects
			for G-Able, JP Morgan, and Singha, among other clients.
